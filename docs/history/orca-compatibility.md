# Legacy Orca public CLI compatibility (historical)

This record belongs to the pre-Pod implementation. [Pod's consolidated specification](pod-spec.md) governs the new product; observations here cannot grant current Pod capability.

This is a bounded compatibility record, not general Orca, provider, WSL, hosted, or release certification.

## Observed contract

The planning and first-increment work used Windows, Python 3.13.15, and Orca 1.4.198. During the prompt-stall correction Orca automatically updated to 1.4.199; the active Dispatch survived the runtime replacement, and the refreshed runtime continued to advertise `orchestration.contract.v1` and `orchestration.worker-launch-preferences.v1`. Version-matched `orca-cli` and `orchestration` guides, command help, and narrowly relevant installed handlers were read from each installed build.

The strict client resolves one executable for the process, invokes argument arrays, decodes contract stdout as strict UTF-8, keeps bounded stderr diagnostics separate, and requires the public envelope to say `ok: true`. Nonzero exit still fails by default. The sole bounded exception is `worker-start`: Orca 1.4.198 and 1.4.199 document and implement exit code 1 for a structured `failed` or `outcome_unknown` result while keeping the envelope `ok: true`, so the client retains that status and the controller validates it with the semantic result. Exit 0 is required for `ready`; ready with any nonzero status, failed/unknown with an unexpected nonzero status, and every non-worker-start nonzero response fail closed. Passive `orchestrate doctor` performs no orchestration mutation.

Orca 1.4.198 normalizes `taskTitle` before storage through its shared task-display contract: trim and collapse ECMAScript whitespace, retain values through 80 UTF-16 code units, otherwise take 77 units, trim trailing whitespace, avoid a dangling high surrogate, and append `...`. The live disposable readback that exposed this boundary preserved the full 5,991-character Task spec but stored a 79-character title (76 objective characters plus `...`) after the controller supplied a 120-character objective slice. The controller now sends the deterministic normalized title and validates that same stored form during creation and resume; packet bytes, native identities, and Task status remain exact independent checks.

## Caller identity observations

A caller with no Orca terminal association failed closed with `no_active_sender_terminal`. Scrubbing environment variables from a subprocess launched by an active terminal is not proof of an independent controller: installed source shows an implicit active-terminal fallback that may select another live identity.

A plain Python process in a fresh ordinary Orca shell successfully owned a Run. In the ordinary PowerShell terminal observed for this correction, `ORCA_TERMINAL_HANDLE`, `ORCA_AGENT_HOOK_TOKEN`, and `ORCA_AGENT_HOOK_ENDPOINT` were present while `ORCA_AGENT_LAUNCH_TOKEN` was absent; `terminal show` omitted `agentIdentity`, `worker-list` succeeded, and no record matched that terminal. A separate reviewer agent's terminal reported `agentIdentity=codex`. These facts mean hook credentials are not agent identity. The implementation therefore binds the exact terminal, worktree, Dispatch inventory, and Run state without clearing environment values, substituting `--from`, or treating terminal resource state as Dispatch status.

A fresh Python process in that same ordinary shell rebound the Run and created a Task. A source-backed architecture assessment confirmed that a dedicated ordinary-terminal bootstrap fits the approved plan and requires no established public API change. It must not pass another terminal through `--from`, transplant identity, or let a dispatched worker route around dispatch depth.

The observed `worker-start` result is flat: exact `runId`, `taskId`, `dispatchId`, `state`, `stage`, `setup`, `launch.requested`, `launch.effective`, `effects`, `residualResources`, and `mutation`. `worker-show` supplies the corresponding Dispatch identity and worker `startOptions`/resource readback. The observed `request-show` result carries `requestId`, `state`, `method`, timestamps, `receipt`, and `interpretation`; only the nested mutation request ID is a retry identity. Terminal create/send/close return their operation-specific resource receipt but no `result.mutation`, so bootstrap records intentions before calls and never retries an uncertain effect.

The Orca 1.4.199 public CLI also exposes `task-create --deps`, `task-list --ready --brief`, `gate-create`, `gate-list`, and `gate-resolve`. The implemented explicit milestone path journals those mutations and validates exact Task/dependency/gate readbacks. Its production controller composition is exercised against synthetic public-command fixtures; no live Task, Dispatch, gate, terminal, release, or provider mutation was performed for this correction, so exact live multi-worker/gate execution remains `NOT_RUN`.

A later parent-owned disposable Orca 1.4.199 exercise exposed two narrower live compatibility facts without certifying this candidate. First, the exact created worker's later `terminal show` retained its handle, connected/writable state, `executionHostId=local`, `agentIdentity=codex`, and exact worktree but omitted `hostPlatform`, even though the create receipt had reported it. Worker preflight now treats the executing Python's supported native platform (`win32` or `linux`), same-file interpreter identity, local execution-host identity, exact terminal/agent/worktree, and single runtime identity as the native-host proof. It records the terminal platform as absent rather than inferring a field Orca did not return. A reported value that differs from the controller platform, WSL execution, absent or non-local execution-host identity, remote/cross-runtime ambiguity, and actor or worktree drift still reject.

Second, current lifecycle message rows carry snake-case envelope fields (`run_id`, `delivery_contract`, `from_handle`, and `to_handle`) while `payload` is a JSON string containing camel-case `taskId` and `dispatchId`. A captured question used the Dispatch address as sender and included its question/options in the payload; a captured escalation used the exact worker-terminal handle. The controller and active probe now decode that raw string only after retaining the whole Delivery, reject malformed/non-object/duplicate-key or mixed-alias payloads, bind the exact Run/Task/Dispatch and destination, and apply type-specific sender trust. Synthetic fixtures use sanitized identities and retain the raw wire encoding.

## Historical failed launch

The first composed `worker-start` attempt created a native Dispatch and then failed `agent_prompt_stalled` at `dispatch_input`, with no working-sequence advance. A later fresh Codex start using the exact `fea035d` wheel reproduced the boundary: the injected packet was visibly buffered, native startup timed out before activity confirmation, and a manual proceed prompt arrived only after Orca had already settled the Dispatch failed. Both attempts remain historical failure evidence; neither is promoted into a successful launch.

Version-matched installed source and guidance explain the hazardous combination. `worker-start` prints its structured result and sets exit code 1 whenever state is not `ready`; the prompt-stall failure retains the Dispatch capability and records the created agent terminal as a residual owned resource, so delayed buffered input can still wake it. Public recovery guidance explicitly directs failed-before-ready owned terminals to idempotent `worker-release`, not a competing terminal close or blind relaunch. A read-only Orca 1.4.199 `worker-show` of the stored historical prompt-stall Dispatch established the post-release shape: Dispatch `failed` with `agent_prompt_stalled`; worker `failed` at its historical execution stage `dispatch_input` with the same error and exact original agent-terminal handle; projection resource state/release/terminal state all `released`; top-level terminal null; missing/non-exact live observation; and the exact Dispatch-owned resource/terminal/worktree triple released with a captured transcript. The corrected local candidate treats that worker history and the terminal-resource disposition independently, requires both exact dimensions in the same readback, and only then records `worker_failed`/`not_run`. The resume regression starts from an already-applied release and proves convergence with one read-only `worker-show` and zero new worker-start, worker-release, terminal-close, Delivery-ack, or verification effects. Focused synthetic contract tests also cover `released`, `already_released`, and `release_pending` convergence against both supported worker-show identity shapes; a new live product launch remains `NOT_RUN`.

Orca 1.4.199 also documents `release_pending` as an exit-0 unresolved result. Installed recovery guidance and the narrowly inspected handler say that Orca retries its committed release after the relevant terminal-inventory or endpoint recovery, without another coordinator decision. The controller therefore persists the full pending receipt and performs only exact `worker-show` readback on restart. A later matching released resource converges; a still-pending or mismatched resource keeps `launch_cleanup_pending`, and the controller issues neither a new worker start, a fresh release mutation, nor an unsupported terminal close. This behavior is covered synthetically; no live release-pending mutation was performed for this candidate.

The 1.4.199 `worker-show` readback changed its primary Dispatch/worker identity fields to camelCase (`runId`, `taskId`, `lastFailure`, `dispatchId`, `worktreeId`, `agentTerminalHandle`, and `lastError`) while retaining equal `dispatch.task_id` as a compatibility field; Task-list rows remain snake_case in the observed build. The 1.4.199 parser requires `lastFailure`, rejects `last_failure`, and requires equal `taskId`/`task_id`; the 1.4.198 parser requires its snake-case identity/failure fields and rejects every camel-case counterpart. The controller launch/readback, managed preflight/admission, bounded submission diagnostic, settlement/release paths, and disposable active doctor share bounded version-keyed validators and reject conflicts, missing fields, or arbitrary mixtures. The exact initial `dispatched`/`ready`/`input_accepted` shape requires null Dispatch failure and worker error, the immutable worker terminal/resource identity, and `owned`/`not_requested` resource disposition. Version-keyed positive tests require ordinary success as `completed`/`succeeded`/`settled` with null failure/error, ordinary failure as `failed`/`failed`/`settled` with `worker_failed`, and prompt-stall as `failed`/`failed`/`dispatch_input` with `agent_prompt_stalled`; all retain the exact original worker-terminal handle. A current readback of a historical ordinary success corroborated `settled` plus the retained worker handle beside a separately released resource. No live released ordinary `worker_done` failure row was available in the bounded current inventory, so its accepted correlation remains the exact documented settlement counterpart rather than a guessed stage alias; arbitrary stages, cleared or substituted handles, attached released terminals, and resource contradictions all reject.

## Later readiness-first evidence

In a separate parent-owned disposable exercise, a fresh Codex terminal reached `tui-idle`; `worker-start --terminal --retry-of <settled-prior-failure>` accepted the Task. An exact succeeded `worker_done` settled the native Task and Dispatch, the whole Delivery was acknowledged, Orca correctly retained the external terminal, and the parent closed its dedicated controller terminal. This proves the public readiness-first composition that informed the implementation. It is not a test of this uncommitted Python candidate and does not rewrite the earlier failure.

The later composed launch also established that `worker-start` can return `ready`/`input_accepted` while the Codex UI still holds the injected task as an unsubmitted draft; one human Enter began the turn, and the symptom recurred on more than one launch. The Orca 1.4.199 public guide says that accepted terminal input is not a started turn and that `terminal send --wait-submit` observes one already accepted prompt without resending, but `worker-start` exposes no corresponding retry-safe turn-start request for this composed launch. `worker-show` documents `observation.agentWait` only for a worker parked on a human-answerable prompt; it does not prove submission of the original task. The controller therefore does not press Enter, scrape the UI, call `terminal send`, or duplicate the task. When foreground observation ends with no preflight, it uses only exact `worker-show` readback to record the bounded unresolved submission diagnostic and leaves the Dispatch active for explicit operator recovery.

The live terminal-exit probe also established the exact receipt shape:

```text
result.wait = {
  handle,
  condition: "exit",
  satisfied: true,
  status: "exited",
  exitCode,
  exitCause: { kind: "exited", exitCode }
}
```

Fast-exiting terminal output was not durably readable from the terminal stream. The bootstrap therefore requires both that native exit receipt and its own atomically written host-local result; missing or contradictory evidence cannot become exit code zero.

Observed structured release readbacks establish owned-and-released and retained `user_takeover` states using exact resource ID, ownership/release/reason, Dispatch ownership, timestamp/error, and archive fields. Live external retention and `no_owned_resource` have not been exercised for this candidate and are not accepted by the implementation.

## Contained no-edit probe

The active doctor probe is retained for narrow compatibility diagnosis. It requires an ordinary terminal in an exact clean disposable Git/Orca worktree with a committed `.orchestrate-disposable` marker. `--active-run-probe` mints a host-local one-use token; the worker probe accepts that token, not an arbitrary Run ID.

Before mutation it read-only verifies the nonce-bearing Run, empty Task inventory, caller binding, worktree identity, and Git baseline. It explicitly places the worker in that disposable worktree, then captures the exact initial Dispatch-owned resource ID, terminal handle, and worktree ID only from the strict null-failure/null-error ready shape and owned/not-requested resource. The raw whole Delivery is written to the host-local one-use probe receipt before parsing or any release/acknowledgment effect. The probe rejects malformed FIFO entries without filtering, verifies an empty `filesModified` declaration plus independent Git readback, and requires the same latest response to match all three captured resource values, the exact outcome-consistent completed/failed Dispatch and worker failure fields, worker stage `settled`, the exact original worker-terminal handle, released resource disposition, and null attached terminal. It settles release only for a fully valid Delivery and accepts the final ack only when `result.acknowledged` equals that exact Delivery.
